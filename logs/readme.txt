The MSB Traffic Counter/Light Control program
will not work properly without them.

To reset the traffic counts for a new season, replace whatever
number is in DAILYTOT.TXT, NOW.TXT, RUNNING.TXT AND TOTAL.TXT with 0
Use notepad.exe to do this, NOT WORD, Openoffice, etc.!

Open MASTER.CSV and delete all data in it using notepad.exe, NOT EXCEL!

MASTER.CSV contains a log with time/date stamps of all vehicles counted.
